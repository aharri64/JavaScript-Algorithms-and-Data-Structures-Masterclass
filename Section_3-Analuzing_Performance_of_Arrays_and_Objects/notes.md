# Section 3: Analyzing Performance of Arrays and Objects

[Site for the slides](https://cs.slides.com/colt_steele/built-in-data-structures-25#/3/0/0)

## OBJECTIVES

- Understand how objects and arrays work, through the lens of Big O
- Explain why adding elements to the beginning of an array is costly
- Compare and contrast the runtime for arrays and objects, as well as built-in methods

## OBJECTS

### Unordered, key value pairs!

```js
let instructor = {
  firstName: "Kelly",
  isInstructor: true,
  favoriteNumbers: [1, 2, 3, 4],
};
```

### When to use objects

- When you don't need order
- When you need fast access / insertion and removal

### Big O of Objects

Insertion - O(1)

Removal - O(1)

Searching - O(N)

Access - O(1)

**When you don't need any ordering, objects are an excellent choice!**

### Big O of Object Methods

Object.keys - O(N)

Object.values - O(N)

Object.entries - O(N)

hasOwnProperty - O(1)

---

## ARRAYS

### Ordered lists!

```js
let names = ["Michael", "Melissa", "Andrea"];

let values = [true, {}, [], 2, "awesome"];
```

## WHEN TO USE ARRAYS

- When you need order
- When you need fast access / insertion and removal (sort of....)

## Big O of Arrays

Insertion - It depends....

Removal - It depends....

Searching - O(N)

Access - O(1)

**Let's see what we mean by that!**

## Big O of Array Operations

<em>You don't need to know all this...</em>

- push - O(1)
- pop - O(1)
- shift - O(N)
- unshift - O(N)
- concat - O(N)
- slice - O(N)
- splice - O(N)
- sort - O(N \* log N)
- forEach/map/filter/reduce/etc. - O(N)

## Limitations of Arrays

Inserting at the beginning is not as easy as we might think! There are **more efficient** data structures for that!
